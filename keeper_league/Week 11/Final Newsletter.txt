Header — “Week 11: Bench players scored a touchdown, owners scored a shrug.”
If fantasy football were a movie, this week would be a low-budget heist where everyone forgot the blueprint but still walked away with someone else’s jewelry. Bench management decided outcomes more than skill; kickers and defenses had their moment in the sun; and yes, someone left Travis Kelce in a box marked “maybe?”

Week 11 in one sentence
Bench blunders and unpredictable RB/TE explosions turned a predictable midseason slog into a soap opera of one-point losses and “why did I do that?” texts.

Quick league snapshot
- Highest single-team score: Here Comes McBride exploded for 148.30 points and probably took the mercy route home.
- Lowest single-team score: Goff And Running flopped to 67.74 — at least their bench didn’t rub it in (it did).
- Biggest upset (by headline-readability): I Know Exactly What I’m Doing routed Goff And Running 97.72–67.74 — sometimes “exactly” is just lucky.
- Closest game: Gronk for my johnson edged D.J. Chark Week 95.00–93.54 — the league’s version of a Tinder date that ends with both regretting nothing.

Matchups (your weekly soap-opera recaps)

Clever Team Name Incoming @ Here Comes McBride — 112.96 @ 148.30
- Headline: “Here Comes McBride turns a Clever idea into a masterpiece 🎯”
- Recap: Here Comes McBride blew the doors off Clever Team Name Incoming 148.30–112.96, thanks to Sean Tucker’s 33.0 and Tetairoa McMillan’s 29.0 — both of whom made fantasy managers question childhood life choices. Clever’s TreVeyon Henderson put up 29.8 and still lost, which is the fantasy equivalent of scoring a hat trick in a 4–3 defeat.
- Bench gag: Brock Purdy sat and scored 19.3 on the bench like a guy who brought a gun to a pillow fight.
- Time-travel quip: Here Comes McBride: To last week, to steal everyone’s waiver wire picks. Clever Team Name Incoming: Back to the draft, with a notebook labeled “This time I start the QBs.”

I Know Exactly What I’m Doing @ Goff And Running — 97.72 @ 67.74
- Headline: “I Know Exactly What I’s modest 30-point mood swing” 
- Recap: I Know Exactly What I’m Doing quietly handled Goff And Running 97.72–67.74 by riding Nico Collins’ 19.7 and some trading-card-level WR depth. Home team’s QB situation (and probably morale) underperformed across the board, leaving Goff And Running to contemplate whether benching three productive guys was performance art.
- Bench gag: Jameson Williams scored 17.7 on the away bench and sent a passive-aggressive GIF to the owner who left him inactive.
- Time-travel quip: I Know Exactly What I’m Doing: To the last five minutes before lineup lock, to actually read injury reports. Goff And Running: To their group chat, to ask why someone forgot how to start players.

Gronk for my johnson @ D.J. Chark Week — 95.00 @ 93.54
- Headline: “Gronk squeaks by D.J. Chark Week in a thriller — bench revenge nearly served” 
- Recap: Gronk for my johnson edged D.J. Chark Week 95.00–93.54 as Bijan Robinson’s 28.3 carried the day and Mark Andrews’ 14.2 sat on the bench like an offended benchwarmer. George Pickens nearly spoiled the party with 24.9, and Kenneth Walker III chipped in the kind of RB output that makes you both proud and afraid.
- Decisive blunder: Christian Watson had 18.6 on D.J. Chark Week’s bench and was left unused — the fantasy equivalent of leaving the parachute at the baggage claim.
- Time-travel quip: Gronk for my johnson: To next week’s trophy photos. D.J. Chark Week: Back to the waiver wire, with an apology to every unsponsored player.

Baker's Brownie Stand @ OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! — 101.82 @ 99.98
- Headline: “Baker’s Brownie Stand takes a slightly stale cake 101.82–99.98” 
- Recap: Baker’s Brownie Stand beat OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! 101.82–99.98, with Christian McCaffrey’s 32.6 and a Steelers D/ST explosion (22.0) doing the heavy lifting. Josh Allen threw a 42.68 day for the home team — the kind of performance that usually buys you a win, not a consolation prize.
- Bench gag: Home team left Travis Kelce on the bench with 19.6 points, which is the fantasy equivalent of turning down free money to remain an artist.
- Time-travel quip: Baker’s Brownie Stand: To the waiver wire, picking up the Steelers for shits and giggles. OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!: To the list of “Why I Don’t Trust My Own Hands.”

THE Derbaum @ Puka Puka — 115.12 @ 97.22
- Headline: “THE Derbaum wins a chess match while Puka Puka tried to play checkers” 
- Recap: THE Derbaum took Puka Puka 115.12–97.22 thanks to George Kittle’s 21.7 and bench sneaks, while Puka’s Dak tossed 24.32 and Travis Etienne did his Etienne thing but not enough. Ja’Marr Chase had a shockingly quiet night (4.5) and A.J. Brown was apparently left on Puka’s bench, which makes for great therapy later.
- Bench gag: Bhayshul Tuten scored 13.4 on the away bench and waved at the owner as they walked off the field.
- Time-travel quip: THE Derbaum: To the offseason, to polish a trophy he doesn’t yet have. Puka Puka: To the bench, to have a long talk about trust.

No Punt Intended @ World of Hurts — 75.32 @ 100.96
- Headline: “World of Hurts puts the hurt on No Punt Intended (and also their QB)” 
- Recap: World of Hurts beat No Punt Intended 100.96–75.32 in a game where Kenneth Gainwell exploded for 26.0 and Jason Myers contributed 14.0 — yes, a kicker was a difference-maker, and nobody was surprised the kicker took it personally. Lamar Jackson and Josh Jacobs both cratered for No Punt Intended, ending the day in the fantasy equivalent of a group therapy session.
- Bench gag: Travis Kelce’s 19.6 sat on the bench like a loaded joke nobody wanted to hear.
- Time-travel quip: World of Hurts: To the trophy case, to see if anything smells like victory. No Punt Intended: Back to their lineup notes with a single tear.

Playoff Picture — who’s snug, who’s sweating, who’s a ghost
- Locked in: Here Comes McBride — 8-3, PF 1216.76 — playoff chance 100.0% (so yes, they’re buying the champagne).
- Very likely/barely breathing comfy: Gronk for my johnson (7-4, 94.38%), THE Derbaum (7-4, 97.5%), Puka Puka (7-4, 94.525%). Treat them like solid but not invincible teams.
- On the bubble: Baker’s Brownie Stand (6-5, 64.45%), No Punt Intended (5-6, 47.70%), OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! (5-6, 36.175%). One hot streak or one bench-ruining mistake from any of these could flip seeds.
- Hanging by a thread: Clever Team Name Incoming (5-6, 19.95%), I Know Exactly What I’m Doing (5-6, 35.4%).
- Long shots / nearly eliminated: Goff And Running (4-7, 4.10%), World of Hurts (4-7, 5.525%), D.J. Chark Week (3-8, 0.3%).
- How Baker’s Brownie Stand makes the playoffs: Win next week and they’ll probably climb into the top 6; if they lose, their 64% evaporates quickly. (Exact multi-team scenarios depend on other results and head‑to‑head tiebreakers — schedule data not provided for full scenario math.)
- How No Punt Intended makes it: They have the PF ammo (1188.26) — string together timely starts and exploit any of the 7–4 teams’ slippage and they’re back in business.

Recurring Feature — Which Marvel character are you? (your teams, in one sentence each)
- Here Comes McBride: Captain America — steady, moral, ends up saving the playoffs.  
- Gronk for my johnson: Thor — swings a hammer (Bijan) and causes collateral delight.  
- THE Derbaum: Doctor Strange — weird magic (TE scoring) that somehow works.  
- Puka Puka: Spider-Man — electrifying when it hits, awkward at dinner.  
- Baker’s Brownie Stand: Iron Man — flashy skill players, occasionally distracted by shiny things.  
- OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!: Hulk — explodes loudly and then sulks.  
- No Punt Intended: Quicksilver — lots of speed/potential but trips at the finish.  
- Clever Team Name Incoming: Ant-Man — underrated until he’s not.  
- I Know Exactly What I’m Doing: Loki — scheming and occasionally terrifying.  
- Goff And Running: Hawkeye — competent, but misses the big shot sometimes.  
- World of Hurts: Nick Fury — pulls surprises out of a trench coat.  
- D.J. Chark Week: Deadpool — chaotic, entertaining, and probably wearing something ridiculous.

Actionable, data-proven advice
- Check your benches: this league’s single biggest swing has been leaving 15–20+ point players inactive (Kelce, Watson, Purdy, Andrews, etc.). Don’t be that person.  
- Kicker and D/ST matter: Jason Myers (14.0) and Steelers D/ST (22.0) swung weeks — pick them by matchup, not loyalty.  
- Start RB/TE upside: recent weeks show RB/TE breakouts are the strongest path to victory.

Sign-off
Lock your lineups, mourn your benched hero privately, and if you want to avoid the “I left Kelce on the bench” talk at the next draft party, donate a six-pack to the eventual trophy holder. I’ll be back next week to roast your roster decisions and celebrate other people’s dumb luck.
