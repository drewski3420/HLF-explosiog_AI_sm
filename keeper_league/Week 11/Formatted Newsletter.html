      <h1>Week 11: Bench players scored a touchdown, owners scored a shrug.</h1>
      <p class="dek">If fantasy football were a movie, this week would be a low-budget heist where everyone forgot the blueprint but still walked away with someone else’s jewelry. Bench management decided outcomes more than skill; kickers and defenses had their moment in the sun; and yes, someone left <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> in a box marked “maybe?”</p>

        <p><strong>Week 11 in one sentence:</strong> Bench blunders and unpredictable RB/TE explosions turned a predictable midseason slog into a soap opera of one-point losses and “why did I do that?” texts.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Quick league snapshot</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Highest single-team score:</strong> <em>Here Comes McBride</em> exploded for <strong class="stat">148.30</strong> points and probably took the mercy route home.</li>
            <li><strong>Lowest single-team score:</strong> <em>Goff And Running</em> flopped to <strong class="stat">67.74</strong> — at least their bench didn’t rub it in (it did).</li>
            <li><strong>Biggest upset (by headline-readability):</strong> <em>I Know Exactly What I’m Doing</em> routed <em>Goff And Running</em> <strong>97.72–67.74</strong> — sometimes “exactly” is just lucky.</li>
            <li><strong>Closest game:</strong> <em>Gronk for my johnson</em> edged <em>D.J. Chark Week</em> <strong>95.00–93.54</strong> — the league’s version of a Tinder date that ends with both regretting nothing.</li>

            <p><span class="pill">Headline</span> “Here Comes McBride turns a Clever idea into a masterpiece 🎯”</p>
            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> Here Comes McBride blew the doors off Clever Team Name Incoming <strong>148.30–112.96</strong>, thanks to <strong>Sean Tucker’s 33.0</strong> and <strong>Tetairoa McMillan’s 29.0</strong> — both of whom made fantasy managers question childhood life choices. Clever’s <strong>TreVeyon Henderson</strong> put up <strong>29.8</strong> and still lost, which is the fantasy equivalent of scoring a hat trick in a 4–3 defeat.</p>
            <p><strong>Bench gag:</strong> <em>Brock Purdy</em> sat and scored <strong>19.3</strong> on the bench like a guy who brought a gun to a pillow fight.</p>

            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> I Know Exactly What I’m Doing quietly handled Goff And Running <strong>97.72–67.74</strong> by riding <strong>Nico Collins’ 19.7</strong> and some trading-card-level WR depth. Home team’s QB situation (and probably morale) underperformed across the board, leaving Goff And Running to contemplate whether benching three productive guys was performance art.</p>
            <p><strong>Bench gag:</strong> <em>Jameson Williams</em> scored <strong>17.7</strong> on the away bench and sent a passive-aggressive GIF to the owner who left him inactive.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Time-travel quip:</strong> I Know Exactly What I’m Doing: To the last five minutes before lineup lock, to actually read injury reports. Goff And Running: To their group chat, to ask why someone forgot how to start players.</p>

            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> Gronk for my johnson edged D.J. Chark Week <strong>95.00–93.54</strong> as <strong>Bijan Robinson’s 28.3</strong> carried the day and <strong>Mark Andrews’ 14.2</strong> sat on the bench like an offended benchwarmer. <strong>George Pickens’ 24.9</strong> nearly spoiled the party, and <strong>Kenneth Walker III</strong> chipped in the kind of RB output that makes you both proud and afraid.</p>
            <p><strong>Decisive blunder:</strong> <em>Christian Watson</em> had <strong>18.6</strong> on D.J. Chark Week’s bench and was left unused — the fantasy equivalent of leaving the parachute at the baggage claim.</p>

            <p><strong>Bench gag:</strong> Home team left <em>Travis Kelce</em> on the bench with <strong>19.6</strong> points, which is the fantasy equivalent of turning down free money to remain an artist.</p>

            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> THE Derbaum took Puka Puka <strong>115.12–97.22</strong> thanks to <strong>George Kittle’s 21.7</strong> and bench sneaks, while Puka’s <strong>Dak</strong> tossed <strong>24.32</strong> and <strong>Travis Etienne</strong> did his Etienne thing but not enough. <strong>Ja’Marr Chase</strong> had a shockingly quiet night (<strong>4.5</strong>) and <strong>A.J. Brown</strong> was apparently left on Puka’s bench, which makes for great therapy later.</p>
            <p><strong>Bench gag:</strong> <em>Bhayshul Tuten</em> scored <strong>13.4</strong> on the away bench and waved at the owner as they walked off the field.</p>

            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> World of Hurts beat No Punt Intended <strong>100.96–75.32</strong> in a game where <strong>Kenneth Gainwell</strong> exploded for <strong>26.0</strong> and <strong>Jason Myers</strong> contributed <strong>14.0</strong> — yes, a kicker was a difference-maker, and nobody was surprised the kicker took it personally. <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong> and <strong>Josh Jacobs</strong> both cratered for No Punt Intended, ending the day in the fantasy equivalent of a group therapy session.</p>
            <p><strong>Bench gag:</strong> <em>Travis Kelce’s</em> <strong>19.6</strong> sat on the bench like a loaded joke nobody wanted to hear.</p>

          <h3>Playoff Picture — who’s snug, who’s sweating, who’s a ghost</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Locked in:</strong> <em>Here Comes McBride</em> — <strong>8-3</strong>, PF <strong>1216.76</strong> — playoff chance <strong class="stat">100.0%</strong> (so yes, they’re buying the champagne).</li>
            <li><strong>Very likely/barely breathing comfy:</strong> <em>Gronk for my johnson</em> (<strong>7-4</strong>, <strong>94.38%</strong>), <em>THE Derbaum</em> (<strong>7-4</strong>, <strong>97.5%</strong>), <em>Puka Puka</em> (<strong>7-4</strong>, <strong>94.525%</strong>). Treat them like solid but not invincible teams.</li>
            <li><strong>On the bubble:</strong> <em>Baker’s Brownie Stand</em> (<strong>6-5</strong>, <strong>64.45%</strong>), <em>No Punt Intended</em> (<strong>5-6</strong>, <strong>47.70%</strong>), <em>OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!</em> (<strong>5-6</strong>, <strong>36.175%</strong>). One hot streak or one bench-ruining mistake from any of these could flip seeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Hanging by a thread:</strong> <em>Clever Team Name Incoming</em> (<strong>5-6</strong>, <strong>19.95%</strong>), <em>I Know Exactly What I’m Doing</em> (<strong>5-6</strong>, <strong>35.4%</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Long shots / nearly eliminated:</strong> <em>Goff And Running</em> (<strong>4-7</strong>, <strong>4.10%</strong>), <em>World of Hurts</em> (<strong>4-7</strong>, <strong>5.525%</strong>), <em>D.J. Chark Week</em> (<strong>3-8</strong>, <strong>0.3%</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>How Baker’s Brownie Stand makes the playoffs:</strong> Win next week and they’ll probably climb into the top 6; if they lose, their 64% evaporates quickly. <span class="note">(Exact multi-team scenarios depend on other results and head‑to‑head tiebreakers — schedule data not provided for full scenario math.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>How No Punt Intended makes it:</strong> They have the PF ammo (<strong>1188.26</strong>) — string together timely starts and exploit any of the 7–4 teams’ slippage and they’re back in business.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Recurring Feature — Which Marvel character are you? (your teams, in one sentence each)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Here Comes McBride:</strong> Captain America — steady, moral, ends up saving the playoffs.</li>
            <li><strong>Gronk for my johnson:</strong> Thor — swings a hammer (Bijan) and causes collateral delight.</li>
            <li><strong>THE Derbaum:</strong> Doctor Strange — weird magic (TE scoring) that somehow works.</li>
            <li><strong>Puka Puka:</strong> Spider-Man — electrifying when it hits, awkward at dinner.</li>
            <li><strong>Baker’s Brownie Stand:</strong> Iron Man — flashy skill players, occasionally distracted by shiny things.</li>
            <li><strong>OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!:</strong> Hulk — explodes loudly and then sulks.</li>
            <li><strong>No Punt Intended:</strong> Quicksilver — lots of speed/potential but trips at the finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Clever Team Name Incoming:</strong> Ant-Man — underrated until he’s not.</li>
            <li><strong>I Know Exactly What I’m Doing:</strong> Loki — scheming and occasionally terrifying.</li>
            <li><strong>Goff And Running:</strong> Hawkeye — competent, but misses the big shot sometimes.</li>
            <li><strong>World of Hurts:</strong> Nick Fury — pulls surprises out of a trench coat.</li>
            <li><strong>D.J. Chark Week:</strong> Deadpool — chaotic, entertaining, and probably wearing something ridiculous.</li>

          <h3>Actionable, data-proven advice</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Check your benches:</strong> this league’s single biggest swing has been leaving <strong>15–20+ point</strong> players inactive (<em>Kelce, Watson, Purdy, Andrews</em>, etc.). Don’t be that person.</li>
            <li><strong>Kicker and D/ST matter:</strong> <em>Jason Myers (14.0)</em> and <em>Steelers D/ST (22.0)</em> swung weeks — pick them by matchup, not loyalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Start RB/TE upside:</strong> recent weeks show RB/TE breakouts are the strongest path to victory.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Final word</h3>
          <p>Lock your lineups, mourn your benched hero privately, and if you want to avoid the “I left <strong>Kelce</strong> on the bench” talk at the next draft party, donate a six-pack to the eventual trophy holder. I’ll be back next week to roast your roster decisions and celebrate other people’s dumb luck.</p>
