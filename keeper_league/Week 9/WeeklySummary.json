Several teams underperformed their projections by large margins, often due to QB or RB failures (e.g., Mahomes, Jonathan Taylor, Jordan Love). A few bench players had big weeks that could have changed results if started (Joe Flacco 30.7, Rico Dowdle 27.1). There were a handful of close games (No Punt Intended beat Gronk for my johnson by ~3.56 points) but the week was dominated by decisive margins and big individual differentials.",
