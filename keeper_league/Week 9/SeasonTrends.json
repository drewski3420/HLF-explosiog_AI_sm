    "overall_narrative": "Through Week 8 the league has been defined by extreme weekly variance driven by bench management, QB volatility, large RB/WR outbursts, and intermittent D/ST and kicker explosions. Multiple teams have won by riding 20+ point performances from mid-tier rostered players and by avoiding the common pitfall of leaving big bench scores unused. Close games (decided by single-digit margins and even tenths of a point) have been frequent, and several teams have alternated hot/cold stretches rather than sustained, steady production."
