Kickers and D/STs also swung outcomes in places (Cairo Santos 19.0; Lions D/ST 20.0). Several close games were decided by small margins and bench decisions: notable unused bench scores include Justin Fields (27.14), Matthew Stafford (27.4), Kenneth Gainwell (28.4), Romeo Doubs (26.8), Woody Marks (25.9), and Drake Maye (23.22).
