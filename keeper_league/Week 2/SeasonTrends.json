Early playoff seeding is primarily a snapshot based on Week 1 Points For among 1-0 teams; many 0-1 teams still have high PF and can rebound quickly. Owners who regularly check and optimize benches should expect to gain an edge in what looks to be a season where one or two lineup decisions per week can swing match results.",
