  "overall_note": "Several matchups were decided by lineup decisions and benching high-scoring players. Multiple teams left significant points on the bench (notably Jared Goff 33.96, Rome Odunze 28.3, Justin Herbert 18.78, Daniel Jones 22.84, Tyler Allgeier 14.5), which swung outcomes. There were a handful of large positive deviations from projections by WRs/WR-heavy stacks (Amon-Ra St. Brown +21.16, Ja'Marr Chase +13.03, Malik Nabers +18.0) and a few defensive/kicker outliers (Brandon Aubrey +13.61, Chargers D/ST +8.21). No explicit roster transactions (trades/waiver adds/drops) are recorded in the provided StatSummary; notable impactful lineup choices are noted per matchup.",
