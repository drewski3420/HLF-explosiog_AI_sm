Header — “Week 10: Where benchwarmers became Greek gods and kickers were villains in a very petty soap opera.”
The waiver wire is a temple and you all treat it like a TGI Friday’s buffet line: chaotic, sticky, and full of regret. Week 10 delivered the usual fantasy emotional roller‑coaster — massive RB explosions, D/STs and kickers gate‑crashing scoreboards, and more fantasy bench crimes than a daytime courtroom special.

Week 10 in one sentence
Bench decisions decided more games than actual starters this week — Jared Goff, Baker Mayfield, and Kimani Vidal walked into the wrong romcom and left their owners heartbroken.

Quick league snapshot
- Highest scoring team: I Know Exactly What I’m Doing — 135.50 points (yes, the name is a flex).
- Lowest scoring team: Baker’s Brownie Stand — 73.50 points (someone left the oven on and the brownies burnt).
- Biggest blowout: World of Hurts obliterated Baker’s Brownie Stand by 44.94 points (Jahmyr Gibbs was a one‑man meteor).
- Closest game: THE Derbaum edged No Punt Intended 133.82–122.84 (10.98 points) — technically a nail‑biter in a league that apparently still uses hammers.

Top matchups — the good, the bad, and the “why did I even draft that”s

Clever Team Name Incoming (103.46) vs Goff And Running (87.80) 🧩
Clever Team Name Incoming survived 103.46–87.80 thanks to TreVeyon Henderson torching his projection for 27.5 points and Cameron Dicker quietly doing kicker things (13.0). Goff And Running had the worst fantasy sin: benching a 24.8 Jared Goff — which, yes, would have changed the vibe entirely. Justin Fields and Derrick Henry underperformed, but it was the benching of Goff (and leaving Jayden Higgins’ 12.7 on the pine) that felt like a murder mystery with no clues.
Where they'd time travel: Clever Team Name Incoming: Back to last Thursday to set an alarm labeled “START JARED GOFF.” Goff And Running: To the draft, with a checklist and a small, ashamed notebook.
Deciding factor: Bench mismanagement (Goff left inactive) — please stop doing this to yourselves.

Here Comes McBride (105.50) vs D.J. Chark Week (86.68) 🏈
Here Comes McBride won 105.50–86.68 on the strength of Trey McBride (23.2) and a Broncos D/ST that actually earned its paycheck (16.0). D.J. Chark Week watched a kicker (Jake Bates, 13.0) sit on the bench like a tragic understudy while James Cook fumbled and Bo Nix cratered vs projection. The victory smelled like smart streaming and favorable matchups — also like someone who brings an expensive appetizer to share and still somehow eats most of it.
Where they'd time travel: Here Comes McBride: To the waiver wire during halftime; D.J. Chark Week: To the “why didn’t I start the kicker” support group.
Deciding factor: Play of the week — strong TE/D/ST output offsetting QB/RB flops for the win.

I Know Exactly What I’m Doing (135.50) vs OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! (115.74) 🎯
I Know Exactly What I’m Doing lived up to the name (for once) with a 135.50–115.74 win fueled by Seahawks D/ST’s monster 21.0, Jameson Williams’ 20.9 flex day, and Caleb Williams’ 25.1. OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! had usable bench gems (Dalton Schultz 14.8, Alec Pierce 16.4) that sat like good investments nobody cashed; Brandon McManus’ 0.0 for OHHHHHHH was a funeral dirge for fantasy points. This was defense + WR fireworks > missed TE/kicker opportunities.
Where they'd time travel: I Know Exactly What I’m Doing: To the trophy case to practice a modest smirk. OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!: Back to the bench to bribe someone to set alerts.
Deciding factor: D/ST made the margin, and the opponent’s zero from their kicker dug a grave.

Gronk for my johnson (77.00) vs Puka Puka (90.22) 🥉
Puka Puka took a 90.22–77.00 win off steady RB and kicker production — Cam Little nailed 13.0 and Travis Etienne Jr. chipped in 14.7. Gronk for my johnson watched A.J. Brown implode to 2.3 points and regretted starting Sam Darnold (4.92, two fumbles) while Dovering Justin Herbert over Jalen Hurts and watching Hurts score 12.02 on the bench. Bonus tragedy: Kimani Vidal’s 17.3 sat unused on the losing side like a spiteful extra credit.
Where they'd time travel: Puka Puka: To the waiver wire with a smug face. Gronk for my johnson: To the living room where they can scream at a television in private.
Deciding factor: QB choice and major WR busts killed Gronk’s upside.

Baker’s Brownie Stand (73.50) vs World of Hurts (118.44) 💥
World of Hurts put a 118.44–73.50 whoopass on Baker’s Brownie Stand thanks to Jahmyr Gibbs unloading for 36.7 and Jason Myers being unexpectedly reliable (15.0). Baker’s Brownie Stand had Baker Mayfield with 22.92 riding the pine and Tyler Allgeier’s 17.7 on the bench — the fantasy sin of the week in high definition. Jordan Love and multiple WRs flopped, and that turned Monday into a personal crisis.
Where they'd time travel: World of Hurts: To the trophy store to pick out “I told you so” accessories. Baker’s Brownie Stand: To their bench to beg for forgiveness.
Deciding factor: Massive single-RB explosion (Gibbs) + unused bench bonus on the losing side.

THE Derbaum (133.82) vs No Punt Intended (122.84) ⚔️
THE Derbaum squeaked out a 133.82–122.84 win anchored by De’Von Achane’s 37.5 and George Kittle’s 18.9 — a tag team nobody wanted to see in the ring. No Punt Intended still lit up the scoreboard but left a Chargers D/ST 16.0 sitting on the bench like a forgotten lottery ticket. This was one of those high‑octane affairs where both rosters scored a lot and the difference was “who forgot to set the bench.”
Where they'd time travel: THE Derbaum: To the afterparty with the MVP sash. No Punt Intended: Back to set an alarm labeled “START THE CHARGERS D/ST.”
Deciding factor: Achane’s breakout and Kittle’s TE day created separation; opponent bench defense haunts them.

Playoff Picture — who’s comfy and who’s clinging to a prayer
- Very likely locks (but not literally sealed in stone): Here Comes McBride (7‑3, playoff chance ~96.0%) and Puka Puka (7‑3, ~97.7%). Both have the look of guys who stopped asking questions and just collect Ws.
- Strongly positioned (probable but still room to blow it): Gronk for my johnson (6‑4, ~83.7%) and THE Derbaum (6‑4, ~86.6%).
- On the bubble (win next week, breathe; lose next week, write a sad ballad): No Punt Intended (5‑4, ~73.5%), Baker’s Brownie Stand (5‑4, ~41.9%), OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!! (5‑4, ~49.4%).
- Long shots but mathematically alive: I Know Exactly What I’m Doing (4‑6, ~17.8%), Goff And Running (4‑6, ~13.2%), D.J. Chark Week (3‑7, ~3.2%), World of Hurts (3‑7, ~2.2%).
How to clinch (very brief, conditional):
- Here Comes McBride keeps riding the 5‑game streak; a win next week probably locks them in given current odds and momentum.
- Puka Puka’s depth and PF cushion (~1069 PF) give them a huge edge — another W and it’s party time.

Recurring feature — Which superhero are you? (one‑line assignments)
- Here Comes McBride: Doctor Strange — mastering strange arts (aka TE streaming) that win games.
- Puka Puka: Captain America — reliable, moral, turns up when you need him.
- Gronk for my johnson: The Hulk — explosive but sometimes misses the nuance.
- THE Derbaum: Spider‑Man — young, explosive, and steals wins from rooftops.
- No Punt Intended: Iron Man — flashy offense, a defense was left in the garage.
- World of Hurts: Thor — hits like a hammer when it matters (Jahmyr was Mjölnir).
- I Know Exactly What I’m Doing: Loki — chaos disguised as genius (and occasionally gets away with it).
- Goff And Running: Hawkeye — arrowed into weird bench choices; precise but sometimes absent.
- D.J. Chark Week: Ant‑Man — small team, rare huge plays (needs help from bigger tech).
- Baker’s Brownie Stand: The Defenders (group decision) — should have turned in a different playbook.
- OHHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!!!!: Wolverine — durable, claws into second chances, needs the right moment to snap.
- Clever Team Name Incoming: Sherlock Holmes — solves matchups by overthinking and, surprisingly, being right.

Final notes & house rules reminder
- Bench management is the league’s recurring murderer: Jared Goff, Baker Mayfield, Kimani Vidal, and Dalton Schultz were the ghosts haunting losses this week. Set alerts. Use the waiver. Stop benching quarterbacks out of principle.
- BYEs and inactives matter more than your feelings about player names. Check rosters before kickoff.

Sign‑off
Set your lineups, stop the benching carnage, and if you’re bringing the trophy beer at season’s end, make it good — we remember who bought cheap lagers. Trash talk in Slack, beg the commish for mercy, and for the love of fantasy football, check your kickers.
