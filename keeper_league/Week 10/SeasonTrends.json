    "Close-game frequency remains high: several matchups across weeks were decided by single digits and a handful by fractions of a point, making bench management and kicker/D/ST decisions disproportionately valuable.",
    "High weekly variance at multiple positions (QB, RB, TE) has kept standings fluid — teams with deeper benches that produce spot-startable weeks have enjoyed more consistent results.",
    "TE scoring has had outsized effects this season: multiple weeks saw TEs produce 15–37 points, altering expected outcomes (Brock Bowers, Dalton Kincaid, Jake Ferguson, Mark Andrews when active).",
    "Defensive and special teams spikes (both positive and negative) have been observed frequently and have determined several matchups; rostering a streaming D/ST strategy has shown measurable payoff in weeks where the D/ST produced 10+ points.",
    "Average team scoring is high but dispersed — while some teams consistently exceed projections, others oscillate week-to-week; Points For is a useful tiebreaker and reflects actual scoring capacity better than record in many cases."
