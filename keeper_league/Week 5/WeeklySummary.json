Defenses were swing factors — some D/STs massively outperformed projections (Colts D/ST 16.0) while others were disasters (Rams D/ST -2.0, Seahawks D/ST -5.0). Injuries/BYEs/inactives also impacted lineups (Tyreek Hill, Mike Evans, Brandon Aiyuk, DJ Moore among notable absences), contributing to variance across rosters.",
