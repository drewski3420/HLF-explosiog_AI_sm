  "overall_note": "Several teams significantly outscored their projections this week (Team Jon, Xavier Marks the Spot, Kraft Montgomery Cheese). Notable D/ST performances swung matchups (Vikings D/ST 32, Buccaneers D/ST 16, Steelers D/ST 15). Multiple teams left high-scoring players on the bench (Hunter Henry 29.0, Dalton Kincaid 17.6, Rashod Bateman 17.3, Jason Myers 17.0), which impacted outcomes in a few close contests. There were a handful of large individual underperformances by expected WRs/QBs (CeeDee Lamb 0.0, Malik Nabers 3.3, Jake Browning 5.9) that changed projected results.",
