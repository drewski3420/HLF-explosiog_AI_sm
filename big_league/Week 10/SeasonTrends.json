  "season_overview": {
    "summary": "Through Week 9 the league has settled into a clear top tier and a crowded middle. Kraft Montgomery Cheese (8-2) and SnydeRemarks (7-3) have the best records; a four-team cluster at 6-4 (Hangin' With Mr. Cooper, Forte Inch Johnson, The Philly Special, 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear) occupies the next rung. The season has been defined by frequent single-player outliers (explosive RB/WR/TE games and occasional QB blowups), consequential bench decisions (many matchups swung by 20+ point bench scores left unused), and several D/ST and kicker performances that created unexpected point swings.",
    "notable_patterns": [
      "High variance weeks: many blowouts (multiple 140+ team totals) and frequent single-digit games; outcomes often decided by a single roster decision.",
      "Frequent large bench swings: managers repeatedly left 20+ point performances unused (examples across weeks: Daniel Jones, Trevor Lawrence, C.J. Stroud, Bijan Robinson, Rico Dowdle, Jordan Love, Justin Fields).",
      "D/ST and kickers have been more impactful than typical—several weeks featured D/STs or kickers producing double-digit, game-deciding outputs (Vikings D/ST 32, Browns D/ST 24, Saints D/ST 18, multiple kickers 17+).",
      "Some teams show consistent high outputs (SnydeRemarks, Kraft) while others are boom-or-bust with big wins offset by sudden collapses (THE Derbaum, Jake Butt Stuff)."
