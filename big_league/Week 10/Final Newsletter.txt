Header — Week 10: The one where the waiver wire wizards smiled and the bench managers wept
If your lineup decisions were a movie this week, they’d be an M. Night Shyamalan — lots of twists, several people inexplicably on the floor, and one gutting reveal where your bench outscored your starters. Single-player explosions and “how did I bench that?!” moments decided more games than coaching acumen.

Week 10 in one sentence
Jonathan Taylor and a handful of RB/defense/kicker freak weeks turned otherwise close affairs into yard-sale blowouts — and yes, multiple teams left 20+ fantasy points on the pine like it was free real estate.

Quick league snapshot
- Highest single-game explosions: Jonathan Taylor (49.6), De’Von Achane (40.5), Jahmyr Gibbs (38.2), TreVeyon Henderson (28.0), and Jahmyr/Gibbs/Henderson were the kind of weeks that make opponents throw their phones.
- Highest season ceiling: SnydeRemarks remains the league’s big-scoring engine (PF 1247.2) while Kraft Montgomery Cheese sits tight as the most consistent seed (8-2).
- Biggest upset (by projection swing): Kraft Montgomery Cheese’s comfortable win over Dickhole Smashers (119.52–58.24) — Smashers’ marquee pieces imploded, and their bench yelled “I told you so.”
- Closest game: Xavier Marks the Spot beat The Philly Special 101.82–97.22 — a four‑point scrape decided by one manager’s bench sin.

Top matchups

Trying to not finish last (away) def. Jake Butt Stuff (home) — 125.5–111.2
- Jonathan Taylor stole the show with a 49.6 game and carried Trying to not finish last to a tidy win; Drake London (24.4) and Theo Johnson (14.5) chipped in like they’d RSVP’d to the party.
- Jake Butt Stuff’s Garrett Wilson ghosted the box score at 0.0, and they left Keon Coleman (13.6) sitting on the bench — which, yes, aged like milk next to Taylor’s steak dinner.
- Where they’d time travel: Trying to not finish last: To Week 1 to pocket a trophy early; Jake Butt Stuff: Back to the draft board with a flamethrower.
- Decisive blunder: Bench Coleman (13.6) was a literal swing; Wilson being a no-show made recovery impossible.

Kraft Montgomery Cheese (away) def. Dickhole Smashers (home) — 119.52–58.24
- Kraft scored efficiently (Dalton Schultz + Davante Adams leading the offense) while Cameron Dicker doing kicker things (13-ish production across the season) turned a tight matchup into a rout.
- Smashers’ once-reliable stars melted — Justin Jefferson (7.7) and Aaron Rodgers (6.44) were non-factors, and Baker Mayfield (22.92) sulked harmlessly on the bench like a betrayed sitcom boyfriend.
- Where they’d time travel: Kraft: To the commissioner’s office to sigh dramatically; Smashers: To a quiet cabin to contemplate roster mismanagement.
- Takeaway: When your top weapons don’t show, and your bench is actually the active roster, you’re playing checkers in a chess tournament.

5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear (away) def. Team Santangelo (home) — 121.3–83.8
- Matthew Stafford (26.9) and Jameson Williams (23.9) supplied the boom for 5WRs; Santangelo’s byes and missing cook-knuckles (Ja’Marr Chase BYE, Austin Ekeler inactive) left them a shell of their usual chaos.
- 5WRs survived the loss of Kelce/Stroud by leaning into WR upside; Santangelo’s Justin Herbert underperformed and the scoreboard punished them.
- Where they’d time travel: 5WRs: To the Kelce cave to borrow his notebook; Santangelo: To their bench to retrieve their missing points.
- Takeaway: Bye weeks are like potholes — you can ignore them, but you’ll regret it.

If Ur Not First You're Last (away) def. Big Trouble in Little Cameron (home) — 115.98–95.0
- Davis Mills’ oddball 27.68-week plus Rome Odunze (20.6) pushed If Ur Not First You're Last to an ace performance, outpacing Big Trouble’s busted WRs (DJ Moore 0.0, Keenan Allen 3.9).
- Big Trouble’s ceiling was amputated by those flops and byes; this was an upset-by-QB-breakout and a reminder that streaming a QB can feel like witchcraft when it works.
- Where they’d time travel: If Ur Not First — To the Mills highlight reel; Big Trouble — To the injury report, to apologize.
- Decisive note: QB volatility won this week; Mills was the coin that landed heads.

Forte Inch Johnson (away) def. Kyler? I Barely Know Her (home) — 117.74–82.32
- George Kittle (23.4), TreVeyon Henderson (28.0) and Seahawks D/ST (21.0) combined to make Forte Inch Johnson look like a roster owned by a man who does his homework.
- Kyler? was robbed of ceiling by Bijan Robinson’s meh (10.8) and Kyler Murray inactive; side note — Forte left Tyler Allgeier (17.7) on the bench and still won, which is both flexing and cruel to the opposite manager.
- Where they’d time travel: Forte Inch Johnson: To a deli at 2 a.m. to celebrate quietly; Kyler?: To an alternate timeline where Murray is healthy.
- Bench-ouch: Allgeier’s benching was cold, calculated, and soul-crushing for fantasy empathy.

Xavier Marks the Spot (away) def. The Philly Special (home) — 101.82–97.22
- Chris Olave (21.4) and Travis Etienne Jr. carried Xavier over the line in a four‑point thriller; Texans D/ST surprised as a productive depth piece.
- Philly left Juwan Johnson (19.2) on the bench — a classic “my bench is louder than my starters” crime — and Jalen Hurts (12.02) didn’t do enough to compensate.
- Where they’d time travel: Xavier: To the waiver wire with confidence; Philly: To their bench, to apologize.
- Decisive blunder: Philly’s unused Juwan Johnson (19.2) was the smoking gun.

SnydeRemarks (away) def. Hangin' With Mr. Cooper (home) — 138.64–108.6
- Balanced fireworks from Emeka Egbuka (23.5) and Jaylen Waddle (19.4) made SnydeRemarks impossible to corral; they keep reminding everyone they’re the team to beat.
- Hangin’ With Mr. Cooper had a monster from De’Von Achane (40.5) but left Tez Johnson and Cade Otton’s production on the bench — nice party, wrong guest list.
- Where they’d time travel: SnydeRemarks: To the trophy case to take measurements; Hangin’: To their bench to salvage self-esteem.
- Takeaway: When your WRs show up like this and your opponent benches one of the best RB weeks of the year, outcomes tilt fast.

THE Derbaum (home) def. Team Jon (away) — 119.68–91.8
- TreVeyon Henderson (28.0) and Jaxson Dart (26.28) combined for THE Derbaum’s punchy week; Team Jon had Jahmyr Gibbs (38.2) but was starved by multiple inactives (Brock Purdy, Tyreek Hill).
- Team Jon’s Jared Goff and Woody Marks ended up as big bench burns; one elite stat line on the other side wasn’t enough without the usual supporting cast.
- Where they’d time travel: THE Derbaum: To the highlight reel; Team Jon: To the medical tent for a roster check-up.
- Decisive note: Two elite RB weeks canceled each other out — depth and active supporting pieces decided it.

League trends & season scoreboard
- Structure: Top tier = Kraft Montgomery Cheese (8-2, PF 1112.82) and SnydeRemarks (7-3, PF 1247.2). Four-team scrum for seeds 3–6 (Hangin’, Forte, Philly Special, 5WRs) makes the next few weeks pure theater.
- Biggest theme: Bench management is the season’s MVP in the negativity awards. If you’ve been leaving 20-point performances on your bench, you’re the reason someone else has a playoff spot.
- D/ST and kickers: Multiple D/STs (Seahawks 21.0, Jets 20.0) and kickers (Myers 15.0, Dicker 13.0) swung games — keep streaming until someone bans the practice.

Playoff picture (post‑Week 9 snapshot + quick math)
- Locked-ish: Kraft Montgomery Cheese (8-2, playoff chance ≈ 99.9%), SnydeRemarks (7-3, ≈ 98.95%) — you can stop refreshing the app.
- On the bubble: Forte Inch Johnson (6-4, ≈ 84.5%), 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear (6-4, ≈ 81.5%), Hangin’ With Mr. Cooper (5-5, ≈ 65%), Trying to not finish last (5-5, ≈ 62.4%) — a single win or a bench-gone-wrong could reshuffle everything.
- Long but alive: Lower teams’ chances drop fast; exact scenarios need full schedule data (not provided). If you want concrete “how X makes the playoffs” bullets, feed me next week’s opponent list and I’ll do the math without crying.

Which Marvel character are you? (A quick league casting)
- Kraft Montgomery Cheese: Captain America — dependable, always in the top 2.
- SnydeRemarks: Iron Man — flashy, expensive, and tends to save the day.
- Forte Inch Johnson: Thor — brings thunder (Henderson/Kittle) when healthy.
- 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear: Spider-Man — scrappy, lots of upside, networked.
- Hangin’ With Mr. Cooper: Hulk — when it smashes, it smashes.
- Trying to not finish last: Ant-Man — underrated and unexpectedly useful.
- THE Derbaum: Doctor Strange — mystical QB/TE combos conjure wins.
- Team Jon: Hawkeye — isolated excellence (Gibbs) but needs support.
- Jake Butt Stuff: Loki — chaotic energy and bench-led mischief.
- Dickhole Smashers: Deadpool — entertaining, self-destructive, occasionally brilliant.
- Team Santangelo: Black Panther — royal potential, hamstrung by absences.
- If Ur Not First You’re Last: The Winter Soldier — gritty surprises.
- Big Trouble in Little Cameron: Ghost Rider — vengeance-laden bust weeks.
- Xavier Marks the Spot: Nick Fury — pulls together the pieces at crunch time.
- Kyler? I Barely Know Her: Falcon — jet-fueled ceiling, weather-dependent.
- The Philly Special: Scarlet Witch — spells work, but sometimes backfire.

Terrible Movie I Actually Own (one-paragraph shame confessional)
I own The 2006 flop The Shaggy Dog on Blu-ray, and no, I will not explain why a grown fantasy‑football columnist has a pristine copy of it. What matters is: sometimes you think you’re getting a family-friendly comedy (read: a solid lineup), and it turns out you’ve been sold a CGI monstrosity that ruins everyone’s afternoon (bye weeks). It’s thematically relevant and deeply embarrassing — like benching Juwan Johnson for no good reason.

Sign-off
Set your lineup, check those byes/inactives, and for the love of fantasy gods don’t let another 20‑point bench day happen on your watch. If you want a Week 10 owners’ checklist (bye/inactive reminders + priority waiver targets + strict start/sit advice using only the projections you gave), say the word and I’ll roast your team choices in verse.
