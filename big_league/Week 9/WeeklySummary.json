  "overall_notes": "This week featured several large deviations from projections: If Ur Not First You're Last (-45.23 vs proj) and THE Derbaum (-25.67) were notable collapses, while Hangin' With Mr. Cooper (+32.79) and SnydeRemarks (+14.63) outperformed expectations. There were multiple big individual outliers (Caleb Williams, Tee Higgins, Brock Bowers, Dalton Kincaid, Christian McCaffrey, Rico Dowdle) that swung matchups. Several close games: Kraft Montgomery Cheese vs Jake Butt Stuff (114.42-107.70) and 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear vs Trying to not finish last (126.44-121.40).",
