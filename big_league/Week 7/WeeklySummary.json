  "overall_notes": "This week featured several games decided by large single-player performances (notably Bo Nix, Jahmyr Gibbs, Ja'Marr Chase/DeVonta Smith combo, and Browns D/ST). Only one close game (Kyler? I Barely Know Her vs The Philly Special, 2.62 points). Multiple teams left high-scoring assets on the bench (Texans D/ST 18.0, Aaron Rodgers 22.56, Dalton Schultz 18.8), and several projected high scorers significantly underperformed (e.g., Justin Fields, Darren Waller, Saquon Barkley).",
