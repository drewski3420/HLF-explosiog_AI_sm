Week 11: Where the waiver wire is still the church nobody attends until it's time to beg forgiveness. High scores, hairline losses, and more bench regrets than an IKEA returns desk.

Week 11 in one sentence
Forte Inch Johnson detonated the scoreboard, a few teams lost by less than a grocery receipt, and roughly half the league quietly asked “did I just bench the guy who scored 30?”

Quick league snapshot
- Highest single-team score: Forte Inch Johnson — 174.28 (this is not a drill).
- Lowest single-team score: Dickhole Smashers — 46.14 (a performance measured in apologies).
- Biggest margin of victory: Jake Butt Stuff blasted the Dickhole Smashers by 56.58 points (102.72–46.14).
- Closest games: Two nail-biters — 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear beat Kyler? I Barely Know Her 118.80–117.38 (1.42) and Team Jon squeaked past SnydeRemarks 101.80–100.92 (0.88). Bring scalpels.

Top matchups (bite-sized recaps)

Jake Butt Stuff 102.72 — Dickhole Smashers 46.14
- The headliner: Jake Butt Stuff leaned on Trey McBride’s 27.5 and a stout Ravens D/ST to turn what looked like a toss-up into a beating. Dickhole Smashers were ghosted by forced inactives (Isiah Pacheco, Rhamondre Stevenson, Rashod Bateman, Dalton Kincaid) and produced the week’s nadir.
- Bench crime scene: Dickhole left Emanuel Wilson (13.9) lounging on the pine like a bad sunburn.
- Where they'd time travel: Dickhole Smashers: Back to the waiver wire with a fire extinguisher; Jake Butt Stuff: To the draft board, smugly.

Trying to not finish last 105.16 — Team Santangelo 62.44
- Verdict: A shocking Sean Tucker 34.0 turned an ordinary Tuesday into a rout; Team Santangelo’s pass game imploded (Justin Herbert 3.34, Ja’Marr Chase 6.0).
- Takeaway: One RB eruption plus opponent QB doom makes fantasy feel unfair and wonderful simultaneously.
- Who they'd summon: Team Santangelo: A sports psychologist; Trying to not finish last: A marching band to celebrate survival.

Big Trouble in Little Cameron 118.12 — Kraft Montgomery Cheese 91.02
- Verdict: Dak, Nico Collins, and Kenneth Walker III combined for a tidy offense to outscore a Kraft team that cashed in on a Steelers D/ST payday (22.0) but couldn’t keep pace.
- Punchline: Balanced gameplan beat D/ST-luck; Kraft’s Davante Adams and Saquon Barkley were non-factors.
- Decisive detail: Big Trouble’s QB/WR combo punched through while Kraft’s core simply didn’t show up.

5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear 118.80 — Kyler? I Barely Know Her 117.38
- Verdict: Kelce awakened with 24.1 and Jameson Williams added 19.7 to squeak past a Bijan/George Pickens fireworks show (Bijan 30.3, Pickens 29.4).
- Bench dagger: Both teams had inconsistent supporting pieces (Puka Nacua was only 14.3 for 5WRs), proving that fantasy is a cruel coin flip.
- Who they'd summon: 5WRsAllowed…: A wizard who specializes in tight ends; Kyler?: A time machine to fix inactives.

If Ur Not First You're Last 109.74 — The Philly Special 95.80
- Verdict: Michael Wilson exploded for 33.5 and A.J. Barner added 17.1 to cover Josh Jacobs’ dud (4.0) and beat Philly’s steady-but-not-stellar Hurts/Diggs day.
- Takeaway: Your WR can carry you when your RB is asleep; also: kickers and D/STs are cheating sometimes (Cairo Santos had 15.0 for Philly).
- Where they'd time travel: Philly Special: To the fourth quarter with Jalen Hurts on a heater; If Ur Not First…: To the trophy case, politely.

Forte Inch Johnson 174.28 — Hangin' With Mr. Cooper 123.74
- Verdict: The single-week blowout of the year: Josh Allen (42.68), Tetairoa McMillan (33.0) and George Kittle (24.7) made the scoreboard cry.
- Hangin' With Mr. Cooper still hit 123.74 (Kenneth Gainwell 29.5), which in most weeks would be trophy-worthy — but not this one.
- Bench gag: Forte’s Ashton Jeanty/Rico Dowdle underperformed their projections, and yet the team still exploded (golf clap to efficiency).
- Where they'd time travel: Forte Inch Johnson: To a highlight reel narrated by Morgan Freeman; Hangin' With Mr. Cooper: Back to the practice squad.

THE Derbaum 129.92 — Xavier Marks the Spot 89.32
- Verdict: TreVeyon Henderson (32.3) and Derrick Henry (20.2) turned THE Derbaum’s backfield into a steamroller; Xavier’s pass-catchers couldn’t answer.
- Notable: Deebo Samuel gave a respectable 20.7 but Xavier’s Khalil Shakir (0.7) and Rachaad White (8.2) flopped.
- Who they'd summon: Xavier: A veteran WR whisperer; THE Derbaum: A forklift to lift morale.

Team Jon 101.80 — SnydeRemarks 100.92
- Verdict: The season’s other fingernail-on-the-chalkboard game — Team Jon eked out the win despite Christian McCaffrey torching defenses for 35.1 (SnydeRemarks), because Lamar Jackson cratered to 4.72.
- Takeaway: Even a McCaffrey earthquake can be neutralized by a QB sinkhole. Start your QBs, people.
- Decisive moment: Lamar Jackson’s meltdown turned a probable stomp into a squeaker.

Playoff Picture (short & snarky)
- Current projected top six (per the snapshot you all forwarded): 1) Kraft Montgomery Cheese, 2) SnydeRemarks, 3) Forte Inch Johnson, 4) 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear, 5) Trying to not finish last, 6) Team Santangelo. Yes, Team Santangelo is listed as the 6-seed in this projection—fantasy math is messy and sometimes vindictive.
- On the bubble: Teams sitting at 5-6 and 6-5 records (THE Derbaum, Hangin' With Mr. Cooper, Big Trouble, Kyler?, Xavier, Team Jon) — they’re alive, hungry, and likely refreshing the waiver wire like it’s a Netflix show.
- Quick conditionals (useful if you like drama):
  - How Team Santangelo stays in: Win next week and lean on projected opponent slip-ups and bench misfires from challengers (schedule specifics not provided; monitor week-by-week).
  - How a 5-6 team climbs in: Win two of the next three head-to-heads and exploit the league’s penchant for one-point head-scratchers — bye weeks and inactives will be decisive.

Weekly “Start/Don’t-Die” checklist (actionable, short)
- Do not leave known inactives on your roster: we saw multiple losses owed to Isiah Pacheco, Kyler Murray, Jayden Daniels, Joe Burrow situations.
- Start: De’Von Achane (Hangin' With Mr. Cooper projects him 27.88 next week) — when his workload looks this healthy, ride him.
- Sit/Consider benching: Tyreek Hill — listed as inactive for Team Jon next week (set your emergency WR).
- Stream aggressively: D/STs and kickers have swung weeks (Steelers 22.0, Browns 16.0, Wil Lutz 18.0, Eddy Pineiro 14.0). If you’re in a one-point game, treat D/ST like a high-yield brownie.

Recurring feature — Which Marvel character are you? (team = character, one line)
- Kraft Montgomery Cheese: Professor X — mastermind with a fragile human shell (but effective).
- SnydeRemarks: Iron Man — flashy points, ego intact, sometimes misses the landing.
- Forte Inch Johnson: The Hulk — when it clicks, everything explodes (and nearby defenses tremble).
- 5WRsAllowedOnRostersNextYear: Dr. Strange — wizardry at TE-time and portals to scoring.
- Trying to not finish last: Hawkeye — quietly efficient and suddenly crucial.
- THE Derbaum: Thor — a hammering ground game that arrives with authority.
- Dickhole Smashers: Loki — chaotic, sometimes brilliant, often punished.
- Team Jon: Captain America — steady, moral, occasionally outpaced by flash.

Terrible Movie I Actually Own (one-paragraph indulgence)
I own and will defend The Adventures of Pluto Nash on principle: it flopped harder than a bench QBs’ ad-lib, but there’s something indulgent about a spectacular failure — much like some of your weekly lineups. If your team feels like a $100 million bust this week, at least you’re entertaining.

Sign-off
Lock your lineups, check inactives, and stop benching guys who go nuclear (I see you, Dickhole Smashers). Complain to the commissioner in the group chat, donate a beer to the eventual champ, and for the love of fantasy, don’t trust kickers unless you’re ready to be pleasantly surprised. See you in Week 12 — bring outrage and waiver claims.
